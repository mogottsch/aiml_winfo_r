## Case: Flight delays in NYC

We will work with a dataset containing airline on-time data for all flights departing NYC in 2013. A flight delay is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time. [More...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_cancellation_and_delay)

The dataset also includes useful meta-data on airlines, airports, weather, and planes. [More...](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf).

# Load data

The following class diagram describes the structure of the dataset.

![](Figures/nycflights13.png){width="500px"}

Import `flights` dataframe from `nycflights13` package.

```{r}
data( flights )
```

Look at the first couple of rows of the `flights` dataframe.

```{r}
head( flights )
```

Import `airports` dataframe.

```{r}
data( airports )
head( airports )
```

Import `airlines` dataframe.

```{r}
data( airlines )
head( airlines )
```

Import `planes` dataframe.

```{r}
data( planes )
head( planes )

```

Import `weather` dataframe.

```{r}
data( weather )
head( weather )
```

# Transform data

First, let's filter out observations with 0 `distance` or `air_time`.

```{r}
flights <- flights %>% 
  filter( distance > 0 ) %>% 
  filter( air_time > 0 ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday = factor( wday( time_hour, label = TRUE )),
    month_name = factor( month( time_hour, label = TRUE )),
    hour_of_day = hour( time_hour )
  )
```

Using SQL-style joins, we can merge the tables together. Here is an overview of the four different types of joints that are possible:

![](Figures/join-venn.png){width="500px"}

The most often used join is the inner-join, which matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal.

![](Figures/join-inner.png){width="500px"}

This is how we join `flights` and `airlines`.

```{r}
head( flights )
head( airlines )

flights_and_airlines <- flights %>% 
  inner_join( airlines )

head( flights_and_airlines )
```

Now joining `flights` and `planes`. Attention: You have to *specify on which columns to join*! Otherwise, `dplyr` will misinterpret the `year` column in the planes table and try to use it for joining the two tables.

```{r}
head( flights )
head( planes )

flights_and_planes <- flights %>% 
  inner_join( planes, by = "tailnum" )

head( flights_and_planes )
```

As you can see above, we don't have information for all tail numbers in the `planes` table. Hence, the *new joined table contains less rows* than the original `flights` table. Using a `left_join` instead of an `inner_join` results in a table with as many rows as the `flights` table, but with some missing values.

```{r}
head( flights )
head( planes )

flights_and_planes_lj <- flights %>% 
  left_join( planes, by = "tailnum" )

head( flights_and_planes_lj )
```

Using `inner_join` without parameters for joining `flights` with `airports` will cause an error, because there are no matching columns in the two tables. Therefore, we have to *explicitly name the columns that should be used as keys* for the join. We have to do this once for the `origin` airport ...

```{r}
head( flights )
head( airports )

flights_and_airports <- flights %>% 
  left_join( airports, by = c( "origin"="faa" ))

head( flights_and_airports )
```

... and once for the destination (`dest`) airport.

```{r}
head( flights )
head( airports )

flights_and_airports <- flights %>% 
  left_join( airports, by = c( "dest"="faa" ))

head( flights_and_airports )
```

Finally, we can join `flights` with `weather`. Note that both tables have composite keys, which should be stated when joining.

```{r}
head( flights )
head( weather )

flights_and_weather <- flights %>% 
  left_join( weather, by = c( "origin", "month", "day", "hour" ))

head( flights_and_weather )
```

Let's create one big table that joins all five dataframes. The join operation produces some duplicate columns and strange column names, so we use `select` and `rename` to clean up the resulting dataframe.

```{r}
flights_all <- flights %>% 
  left_join( airlines, by="carrier" ) %>% 
  left_join( planes, by = "tailnum" ) %>% 
  left_join( airports, by = c( "origin"="faa" )) %>% 
  left_join( airports, by = c( "dest"="faa" )) %>% 
  left_join( weather, by = c( "origin", "month", "day", "hour" )) %>% 
  select( -year.y, -year, -time_hour.y ) %>% 
  rename(
    year = year.x,
    time_hour = time_hour.x,
    carrier_name = name.x,
    origin_name = name.y,
    origin_lat = lat.x,
    origin_lon = lon.x,
    origin_alt = alt.x,
    origin_tz = tz.x,
    origin_dst = dst.x,
    origin_tzone = tzone.x,
    dest_name = name,
    dest_lat = lat.y,
    dest_lon = lon.y,
    dest_alt = alt.y,
    dest_tz = tz.y,
    dest_dst = dst.y,
    dest_tzone = tzone.y
  )

head( flights_all )
```

To save memory, let's remove all unnecessary dataframes.

```{r}
rm( airlines )
rm( airports )
rm( flights )
rm( flights_and_airlines )
rm( flights_and_airports )
rm( flights_and_planes )
rm( flights_and_planes_lj )
rm( flights_and_weather )
rm( planes )
rm( weather )
```

# Explore data

## Visualize categorical variables with bar charts

Plot a simple *bar chart of number of flights by `origin` airport*. A bar chart expects a mapping of a factor variable onto the `x` aesthetics of the plot. By default, the `y` aesthetic will be mapped to the number of observations in each level of the factor variable.

```{r}
flights_all %>%
  ggplot( mapping = aes( x=origin )) +
  geom_bar( )
```

Similarly, we can plot a *bar chart for the number of flights by `carrier`*. Note that the bars are not ordered by frequency, but alphabetically.

```{r}
flights_all %>% 
  ggplot( mapping = aes( x=carrier )) +
  geom_bar( )
```

If you want to *order the bars* by frequency, you have to manually order the factor levels by frequency before plotting the data.

```{r}
flights_all <- flights_all %>%
  mutate( carrier = fct_infreq( carrier ))

flights_all %>%
ggplot( mapping = aes( x=carrier )) +
  geom_bar( )
```

We can *make the plot nicer* by and adding more descriptive labels to the x and y axes.

```{r}
flights_all %>%
  ggplot( mapping = aes( x=carrier )) +
  geom_bar( ) +
  labs( title = "Who are the biggest airlines in NYC?",
        x = "Airline Code", 
        y = "Number of flights leaving JFK",
        caption = "Note: Data about domestic flights from 2013." )
```

## Visualize numerical variables with histograms and boxplots

A *histogram* is an easy to interpret visualization of the distribution of a numerical variable. Here, we plot a histogram of the distance of all flights. The parameter `bins` controls how fine-granular the resolution of the histogram should be.

```{r}
flights_all %>%
  ggplot( mapping = aes( x=distance )) +
  geom_histogram( bins=50 ) 
```

Using facets, we can visualize and compare distributions of different subsets of the data. Here, we split the data by `origin` and plot three *histograms side-by-side*.

```{r}
flights_all %>%
  ggplot( mapping = aes( x=distance ) ) +
  geom_histogram( bins=30 ) +
  facet_wrap( ~origin )
```

**Your task:** Create a bar chart with facets for visualizing `dep_delay` by `month`.

```{r}
flights_all %>%
  ggplot( mapping = aes( x=dep_delay ) ) +
  geom_histogram( bins=30 ) +
  facet_wrap( ~month )
```

Instead of using discrete histograms, we can also draw a continuous *density plot*.

```{r}
flights_all %>%
  ggplot( mapping = aes( x=distance )) +
  geom_density( fill="lightblue" ) 
```
```{r}
flights_all %>%
  aes( x=distance )
```

*Ridgeline density plots* are a good solution for visualizing many distributions in one plot. Ridgeline plots are partially overlapping and can, hence, save some space. The parameter alpha controls the opaqueness of the fill colors in the plot.

```{r}
flights_all %>%
ggplot( mapping=aes( x = month, y = carrier ) ) + 
  geom_density_ridges( alpha=0.5 )
```

**Your task:** Create a ridgeline density plot for temperatures by month.

```{r}
flights_all %>%
ggplot( mapping=aes( x = temp, y = month ) ) + 
  geom_density_ridges( alpha=0.5 )
```
```{r}
flights_all %>%
  ggplot( mapping=aes( x = temp, y = as.factor(month) ) ) +
  geom_density_ridges( alpha=0.5 )
```

A *box plot* is another alternative for visualizing the distribution of a numerical variable. It also shows the quartiles of the distribution and potential outliers. [More about box plots...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot)

```{r}
flights_all %>%
  ggplot( mapping = aes( y=distance, x="All flight" )) +
  geom_boxplot( )
```

Box plots are also useful for showing *many distributions at once*.

```{r}
flights_all %>% 
  ggplot( mapping = aes( y=distance, x=origin )) +
  geom_boxplot( ) 
```

**Your task:** Create multiple box plots of `distance` by `carrier`.

```{r}
flights_all %>% 
  ggplot( mapping = aes( y=distance, x=carrier )) +
  geom_boxplot( ) 
```

## Visualizing correlations between numerical variables with scatterplots

*Scatterplots show the association between two numerical variables*; for example, `distance` and `air_time`. Note: Because of performance reasons, we only plot a random sample of 10% of all the flights here.

```{r}
flights_all_sample <- flights_all %>% 
  sample_frac(0.1)

flights_all_sample %>%
  ggplot( mapping=aes( x=distance, y=air_time )) +
  geom_bin_2d( bins=100 )
```

We can easily *add a linear trend line* to the scatterplot. Not surprisingly, we see a perfect linear relationship between the two variables. Using the `method` `gam` allows to show non-linear trends.

```{r}
flights_all_sample %>%
  ggplot( mapping=aes( x=distance, y=air_time )) +
  geom_point( alpha=0.1 ) +
  geom_bin_2d( bins=100, alpha=0.1 ) + 
  geom_smooth( method = "lm" )
```

For datasets with many continuous variables, it is often useful to create a *scatterplot matrix*. The `GGally` package provides nice functions (e.g., `ggpairs`, `ggcor`) for this.

```{r}
flights_all_sample_selected <- flights_all_sample %>% 
  select( air_time, distance, dep_delay, arr_delay )

ggpairs( flights_all_sample_selected )
```

# Your task

Visually explore the relationship between weather and delays. First, investigate the distributions of single variables, then look at bi-variate relationships...

```{r}
flights_all_sample_selected <- flights_all_sample %>% 
  select( temp, dewp, wind_speed, humid, dep_delay, arr_delay )

ggpairs( flights_all_sample_selected )

# The first who has the solution may post it to Slack.
```
